Welcome to the antcpu github!

We have created our new major files that we use for web development.
This is a wonderful place to build and we are glad yo be here.

Our main focus is to use html files with built in javascript and css.
When those files get to large in size we have included sepetate files for function.

We also have created a wiki to map out our projects and give access to our favorites.
